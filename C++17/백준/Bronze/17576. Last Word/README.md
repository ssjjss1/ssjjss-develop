### 문제 설명

<p>The <code>substring()</code> function is a commonly-used operation available in most programming languages that operates on strings. A start offset and a length are provided and used to construct a new string containing only the characters in a sequence of that length beginning from the offset.</p>

<p>One particular string has had this called a large number of times in sequence: we repeatedly used the standard library function <code>substring(s, start, length)</code> to chop it up until now a potentially much shorter string remains.</p>

<p>Find the value of the string produced by all of these operations.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>The first line of input contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>).</li>
	<li>The second line of input contains the number of operations, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>).</li>
	<li>Each of the following n lines contains the two integers start<sub>i</sub> and length<sub>i</sub> (0 ≤ start<sub>i</sub> < length<sub>i−1</sub>; 1 ≤ start<sub>i</sub> + length<sub>i</sub> ≤ length<sub>i−1</sub>).</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the string after all of the successive substring() operations.</p>
